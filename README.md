The project integrates trajectory planning and motion profile functionality into a 6-axis quantum robot system. The hardware configuration and software environment are set up, and a trajectory planning algorithm is developed using mathematical models 1D and 3D. This algorithm accommodates triangular and trapezoidal and s-curve motion profiles, ensuring controlled acceleration and deceleration. The jog axis control feature allows manual adjustments.Rigid testing and validation ensure the functionalities' reliability, providing a comprehensive solution for precise robotic motion in industrial settings.
